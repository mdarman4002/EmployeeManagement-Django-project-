# EmployeeManagement

How to manage static files (e.g. images, JavaScript, CSS)  https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/howto/static-files/

## Project Description
The Employee Management System I developed using Django is a web application that simplifies employee data management. It allows administrators to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for employee records such as name, department, role, and salary. The system is built with Django's MVC architecture, ensuring scalability and maintainability.

For data storage, I utilized SQLite, Djangoâ€™s default lightweight database, which efficiently handles employee records. The project includes user authentication for secure access and role-based permissions to ensure that only authorized users can manage or view sensitive data. I implemented dynamic forms for easy data entry, and the interface is styled using Bootstrap, providing a clean and responsive user experience.

Additionally, the system offers features like search, filtering, and a dashboard for visualizing key employee metrics. This project helped me strengthen my skills in Django, Python, and database management while also providing experience in full-stack development.
